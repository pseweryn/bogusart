this repo contains code, markup and content of a website which presents works of Zbigniew Boguslawski (painter, photographer, tattoo maker and a friend of mine)

technologies
========
HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Sammy.js, Mustache.js, Innerfade.js, h5bp, Bootstrap .. and many other cool things I've been checking out, implementing, evaluating, then removing .. and so on

highlights 
========
- hash-based navigation which provides single page application look and feel (courtesy of Sammy.js)
- semi-responsive web design

issues
========
website is image-heavy so performance leaves much room for improvement

the future
========
coming soon
